I wanted to make this for newer developers who are looking to have an easier time reading through code and understanding how things tie together. This theme is ispired by the Halcyon vscode theme extension. This builds uppon that base by seperating variables, parameters, functions, strings, and numbers as different colors.

This is the insporation for my theme, here you can see the difference in readability! Keep in mind, I mostly work in HTML, CSS, JS, and React so things might be different on your end, but feel free to try it out and see if you like it!
